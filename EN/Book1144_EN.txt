Month: Unknown. Day: Unknown...
What a brutal fight...
I refused the locals' aid and held this lighthouse alone. Now, I'm the only one left...
Ah, and this wolf... the one that came with us from Mondstadt...
The master went off, tracking the monsters. I don't know if he's coming back...
But it doesn't matter now. Covered in blood, limbs being turned to stone, I can't follow him anymore...
The end of this path of chivalry... only he, and these crows drawn by the scent of blood, will see it.
I won't leave my body to them...
Well, wolf from my homeland... consider this your last escort duty.
