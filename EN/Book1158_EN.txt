Month: Unknown. Day: Unknown...
Recently, the troops stationed on the plains keep hearing eerie and sorrowful howls. I wonder if this is the Abyss's latest ploy to prey on people's fears. During my patrols, I've spotted the figures of Phantom Wolves appearing among these desolate ruins. Much like near the lighthouse, piercing wolf cries can also be heard here.
I'll mark this spot for now. On the next patrol, I must bring more personnel to conduct a thorough search. It seems the Abyss is also lurking nearby, poised to stir.
