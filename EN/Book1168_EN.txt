■/■, The captain received an order from Piramida today. As the support squad, we are to clear several Wild Hunt nests around Kipumaki Cliff. To be honest, this is the best news I have had in days. No, in months.At last, I will go to the battlefield. At last, I can prove myself. Filyaev the Lightkeeper, remembered by the generations to come, is finally about to have his first battle!
