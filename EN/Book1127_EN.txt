In the end, all those fervent, noble, and futile dreams will dissolve like tears,
like the countless fantasies born in the past, disappearing with the piercing cold wind.
Whether born of true intention or the self-indulgent romance of illusion,
all paths lead to the same end. No one can escape a reality that falls short of their dreams, leaving their story to be rewritten by others.

The prophesied ruler, who never became ruler, couldn't live to witness his Elysium where all sorrows were swept away.
The borderless world he dreamed of had become a jest for bandits.
The usurper, who never became the sacred heir, couldn't break the chains that bound his family's blood,
leaving behind a helpless servant to sing evening prayers beneath the Nightingale's Spire.
The Governor's adopted son, who never became a master thief, couldn't save the life of his loved one,
but steal a false name of a forgotten commoner, pretending to be a hero who was no longer dangerous.

But what did it matter? The world she longed for was simply one where everyone could laugh without burden.
Even if it was all an unsubstantial and ridiculous fake, it was still a proof that their dreams had come true.
A fake isn't worthless. Just like these token you've found, even though they are but my craft,
rather than echoes surging within Ley Lines, they can still guide you to our great treasure.

Since grandiose history will only record the stories of the nobles,
I will carve the names of the lowly in the way taught by the Moon Messenger.
As the one I love but cannot possess said, I have no profound thoughts,
This is merely the mockery of a wanderer without accomplishment, presumptuously aiming for the high heavens.
