To "No Late Drafts" Souka:
The photos of Blitzara have arrived. Both Aratani and I have received them.
If all goes smoothly, in about half a year, the artist you've been most eager to work with should finally have an opening. She'll be creating the official manga design for Blitzara.
Out of consideration for the overall visual quality of the project, she'll also be taking on the designs for the entire main cast's Fungus companions.
So, before that happens, make sure everything is properly finalized, all right? And when preparing the brief, please be as clear and detailed as possible.
Since you're in Sumeru, delivering physical drafts will be a hassle. Keep that in mind and plan ahead, we should try to minimize back-and-forth as much as we can.
Now, there’s one more thing, not too serious, but not insignificant either.
Living the life of a mercenary can be good experience, sure. But please don't fully adopt that same free-spirited attitude when dealing with paperwork.
When Aratani received your last draft, he genuinely wondered whether you'd hired a mercenary to ghostwrite it... or perhaps dictated it aloud while someone else hurriedly took notes.
Compared to your neat handwriting from a few years ago, it barely looked like it came from the same person. Aratani had to work very hard just to decipher each word.
Abusing your colleagues is not a good habit. Next time, please make sure you write each line properly and with care.
Otherwise, if Aratani ends up taking sick leave, I'll be assigning all the editing work to you...
That said, setting those issues aside, your progress this time is genuinely encouraging.
For one, you've clearly reduced unnecessary ornamental language. You've also moved away from exaggerated rhetoric, opting instead for a plainer but more sincere writing style.
More importantly, there's been a noticeable shift in how you structure your stories. Rather than starting with a "big moment" and retroactively building the surrounding plot, you now focus more on internal character consistency, their motivations, and the overall narrative flow...
Perhaps The Fungi Clan will be the starting point that sets you on the path to becoming a true light-novel master.
Looking forward to your finished draft~
