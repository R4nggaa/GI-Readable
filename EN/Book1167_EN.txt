■/■, I have lost track of how many days I have been stationed at Kipumaki Cliff. Perhaps it has already been months. Each day feels as if it will never end, as though I am trapped living the same one over and over. I rise at six each morning to train with the captain. After that, I search for fruit or hunt small game to fill our rations. Then Chinnov takes over my watch, and I get a moment to stare at the jagged walls of Kipumaki Cliff and let my mind drift. I imagine what my battles against the Wild Hunt will look like one day. I truly don't know what Schonovich hopes to write about in a squad like ours. Can he really produce a great poem of military life from this?
